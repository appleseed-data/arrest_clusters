# arrest_clusters analysis

This project processes arrest data from Chicago Police Department into an analysis-friendly format and runs several types of analysis. 


## Source

Based on data from the Chicago Data Portal. See disclaimer at bottom.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/appleseed-data/arrest_clusters
```

2. Create a new conda environment from the environment.yml file. This is optional but highly recommended, but you can use your own env instead.

```terminal
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

* Note, in some cases the conda env setup fails but does create an environment called arrest_clusters. If that's the case, activate the arrest_clusters environment and install dependencies with pip, see next. 

To switch conda envs:
```terminal
conda activate arrest_clusters
```

3. Install depedencies (recommend that you use the arrest_clusters env as noted above, but you can install this in any environment of your choosing.).

```terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. From terminal, run the application

```terminal
python main.py
```
