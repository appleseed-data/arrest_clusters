# arrest_clusters analysis

This project processes arrest data from Chicago Police Department into an analysis-friendly format and runs several types of analysis. 


## Source

Based on data from the Chicago Data Portal. See disclaimer at bottom.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/appleseed-data/arrest_clusters
```

2. Create a new conda environment from the environment.yml file. This is optional but highly recommended, but you can use your own env instead.

```terminal
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

* Note, in some cases the conda env setup fails but does create an environment called arrest_clusters. If that's the case, activate the arrest_clusters environment and install dependencies with pip, see next. 

To switch conda envs:
```terminal
conda activate arrest_clusters
```

3. Install depedencies (recommend that you use the arrest_clusters env as noted above, but you can install this in any environment of your choosing.).

```terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. From terminal, run the application

```terminal
python main.py
```

## Data

### Data Prep

A brief description of the data pipeline to process source arrest data. 

* TBP 

  
### Data Classification of Arrest Charge Descriptions

A brief description of charge classifications. 

* What: Convert raw text of arrest charge description to one of many discrete, semantic categories of arrest. 
* Why: There are thousands of charge descriptions that vary slightly but are fundamentally the same type of arrest charge, reducing the number of unique charges into discrete categories makes analysis simpler to perform. 
* How: Leverage a labeled dataset of charge descriptions to categories from this worksheet [CPD Crosswalk](https://github.com/appleseed-data/arrest_clusters/blob/main/data/CPD_crosswalk_final.xlsx) and apply classification methods.

#### Classification Methods to Map Charge Descriptions to Categories

A brief description of how charge classifications are performed.

* Direct Match on Text with Crosswalk: Where there is a direct match in the labeled dataset, map the associated charge categories to the charge description.
* Fuzzy Match on Text with Crosswalk: Where there is a slight (fuzzy) difference between the labeled dataset and the charge description (an edit distance of 4), map the charge description to a charge category.
* NLP Match on Text with Crosswalk: If any charges are not mapped after direct and fuzzy match, learn a model to peform multi-class text classification of charge descriptions to charge categories using Naive Bayes, then apply the model to claassify texts.

## Analysis

* TBP
